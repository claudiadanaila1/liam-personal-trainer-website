Milestone project -USER CENTRIC FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT

## Project name - LIAM PERSONAL TRAINER - website


This website concept is to create a business web presence for Liam, through which he can reach possible clients as well as advertising his services.

## UX


This website is made for a personal trainer who is present on social media but is lacking a professional web presence.
The goal was to have a clean, legible and to-the-point content, wherein a short presentation about Liam, the available services/trainings 
is given without having a crowded page.   
The aim of the design was to have a simple, clear, clean and minimalistic website, where content and images have a consistent style throughout the 
website.  
As a user type I want to have access to clear and useful information about the offered services and also possibility to purchase them.    
As a user type I want to be able to send get in contact with Liam through a form which is easily filled in.  

## Features

This site uses the bootstrap grid system, which is a mobile first responsive design.   

Features to implement:  
Link the buttons "Start now" to a order page where you can fill in a purchase form.  
Add a section with user testimonials and before and after pictures. 


The site as it is now is clean and doesn't have many features, the user-interaction requires work; looking back at the whole development process
I can say that I learn from it and for the next project the approach will be different.
All the isuess I have encountered while doing this project made me think more about the importance of html structure and how it affects the styling
of the elements therefore I will pay extra attention at the html structure and at user experience.


## Technologies used

1. HTML5 - to create, define the structure and layout of the web document - [HTML-wikipedia link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
2. CSS - to style the web document - [CSS-wikipedia link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
3. Bootstrap - to create a  responsive mobile-first website - [Bootstrap link.](https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. JS, jQuery - for bootstrap components - [Bootstrap link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#js)

## Testing

The website was tested manually to ensure compatibility and responsive on smaller devices and tablets. 
On smaller devices the navigation menu collapses into a burger menu.  

The contact form: 
1. Go to "Contact" page
2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and an error message about the required valid email address appears  

Footer  
The online-form link on the "Contact me" section of the footer is linked to the contact form of the "contact" page.  
The email address link opens in a new tab. 

Submit buttons  
On click the submit buttons an alert messages will appear; this makes the website more interactive.

This site is deployed on GitHub pages and uses the master branch and it updates every time there is a new push to the repository.
