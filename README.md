## Project name - LIAM PERSONAL TRAINER - website


This website concept is to create a business web presence for Liam, through which he can reach possible clients as well as advertising his services.

## UX


This website is made for a personal trainer who is very present on social media but is lacking a professional web presence.
The goal was to have a clean, legible and to-the-point content, wherein a short presentation about Liam, about the available services/trainings 
is given without having a crowded page. 
The aim of the design was to have a clear, clean and minimalistic website, where content and images have a consistent style throughout the 
website.
